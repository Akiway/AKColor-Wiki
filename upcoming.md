# Bugs

# Upgrades
- Give the possibility to hide the left menu (and show it when hovering the border).
- Color picker : Improve the scroll in order to hide the closer color balls and give the possibility to see other balls inside the shape.
  
  Maybe changing the default range of view, camera position and raycasting.
  
  Maybe using an input range to remove the layers of the shape one by one (like an ognion).
  
  Or removing layers simply by scrolling (or both possibilities with a setting, sounds cool).
- Support of the HWB format
- Support of the CMYK format
- Support of the 4 and 8 hexadecimal value that includes the opacity (#RGBA & #RRGGBBAA)
